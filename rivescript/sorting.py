    """Sort a group of triggers in optimal sorting order.

    The optimal sorting order is, briefly:
    * Atomic triggers (containing nothing but plain words and alternation
      groups) are on top, with triggers containing the most words coming
      first. Triggers with equal word counts are sorted by length, and then
      alphabetically if they have the same length.
    * Triggers containing optionals are sorted next, by word count like
      atomic triggers.
    * Triggers containing wildcards are next, with ``_`` (alphabetic)
      wildcards on top, then ``#`` (numeric) and finally ``*``.
    * At the bottom of the sorted list are triggers consisting of only a
      single wildcard, in the order: ``_``, ``#``, ``*``.

    Triggers that have ``{weight}`` tags are grouped together by weight
    value and sorted amongst themselves. Higher weighted groups are then
    ordered before lower weighted groups regardless of the normal sorting
    algorithm.

    Triggers that come from topics which inherit other topics are also
    sorted with higher priority than triggers from the inherited topics.

    Arguments:
        triggers ([]str): Array of triggers to sort.
        exclude_previous (bool): Create a sort buffer for 'previous' triggers.
        say (function): A reference to ``RiveScript._say()`` or provide your
            own function.
