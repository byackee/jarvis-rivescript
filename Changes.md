Revision history for the Python package RiveScript.

1.14.3  Dec  8 2016
  - Fix sorting algorithm for triggers with `%Previous`, making their sort order
    deterministic and correct regardless of the order they appeared in the
    source file (PR #60; bug #59)
  - Fix a possible crash when interpolating a `<star>` tag when the trigger
    had captured no stars. In this cases the `<star>` tag will become the string
    `"None"`; it is a user error that this situation arises anyway and this fix
    just prevents Python from crashing (bugs #51 and #54)
  - Fix a possible crash when calling `random.choice` on an empty list by
    wrapping it in a safety function at `rivescript.utils.random_choice`
    (bug #36)
  - Better error reporting on the JSON Interactive Mode: if there is an
    exception raised when decoding the input JSON, the output JSON now contains
    an `error` key with the text of the exception to help diagnose what went
    wrong.

1.14.2  Oct 18 2016
  - Fix numeric tags like `<add>` raising a `TypeError` exception.

1.14.1  Aug 9 2016
  - Fix a regression when handling Unicode strings under Python 2 (bug #40).

1.14.0  Jul 23 2016
  - Make the session manager pluggable and replaceable. RiveScript still uses
    an in-memory store for user variables, but this can be swapped out with a
    replacement that puts user variables somewhere else, like Redis or MySQL.
    The constructor accepts a `session_manager` parameter to use your own
    session manager based on the `rivescript.sessions.SessionManager` class.
  - Make the RiveScript Parser module (`rivescript.parser`) more developer
    friendly by removing the parent RiveScript module as a dependency. The
    parser can be used as a stand-alone module if all you want to do is parse
    and validate RiveScript code.
  - The `log` parameter to the constructor may now be an already opened file
    handle (opened in write or append mode) instead of a string, if you already
    have a file handle ready.
  - Add two examples to the `eg` directory:
    - `eg/sessions` replaces the in-memory session store with one that uses
      a Redis cache instead.
    - `eg/parser` shows how to use the RiveScript Parser module.
  - Fix a bug where atomic triggers that contain a `{weight}` tag were unable
    to be matched properly.
  - Reorganize the unit tests into many smaller files instead of one large one.

1.13.0  Jul 21 2016
  - Restructure the code to keep it on par with the JavaScript and Go versions:
    - `rivescript.parser` now contains all the parsing code:
      `parse()` and `check_syntax()` are moved here.
    - Triggers are stored internally in only one place now, like in the
      JavaScript and Go versions. This makes some internal mappings simpler as
      they now point to common references and don't duplicate data in memory.
    - **Note:** Most of the new `rivescript.*` modules are still
      private-use-only, even though many internal functions lost their
      underscore prefixes. You should still only use the API functions exposed
      by `rivescript.rivescript` or what is exported by the top level package.
      The `rivescript.parser` API will be more public-facing in the future to
      help with third party integrations (currently it still relies on a Python
      object with methods `_say` and `_warn`).
  - Refactor the RiveScript interactive mode (`rivescript.interactive`) to use
    argparse instead of getopt and add a pretty ASCII logo.
  - Add `shell.py` as a possibly easier-to-access (and certainly
    easier-to-discover) shortcut to running RiveScript's interactive mode.
    It accepts all the same options and works the same as before.

1.12.3  Jul 8 2016
  - Fix the Python object macro handler to use `six.text_type` on the return
    value, allowing Python 2 objects to return Unicode strings.

1.12.2  May 31 2016
  - Fix a couple of bugs with `set_uservars()`.

1.12.1  May 31 2016
  - Added API functions: `get_global(name)`, `get_variable(name)`, and
    `set_uservars(user || dict[, dict])` -- the latter is for setting many
    variables for a user at once, or for setting many variables for many users.
    Refer to the API documentation for details.

1.12.0  May 10 2016
  - Add support for nested arrays, like `!array colors = @rgb white black`
    (PR #22)

1.10.0  Feb 16 2016
  - Add configurable `unicode_punctuation` attribute to strip out punctuation
    when running in UTF-8 mode.

1.8.1  Nov 19 2015
  - Add `@` to the list of characters that disqualifies a trigger from being
    considered "atomic"

1.8.0  Oct 10 2015
  - New algorithm for handling variable tags (<get>, <set>, <add>, <sub>,
    <mult>, <div>, <bot> and <env>) that allows for iterative nesting of
    these tags (for example, <set copy=<get orig>> will work now).
  - Fix sorting algorithm, so triggers with matching word counts will be
    sorted by length descending.
  - stream() function can accept a multiline string instead of an array
  - Speed optimization by precompiling as many regexps as possible (what was
    especially helpful was to precompile substitution and simple trigger
    regexps), taking the time-to-reply for the default brain from ~0.19s down
    to ~0.04s
  - Add support for `! local concat` option to override concatenation mode
    (file scoped)
  - Fix the regexp used when matching optionals so that the triggers don't match
    on inputs where they shouldn't. (RiveScript-JS issue #46)

1.06  Nov 25 2014
  - Change package name from python-rivescript to simply rivescript.
  - Change from the GPLv2 license to the MIT license.
  - Add compatibility with Python 3.
  - Add Unicode support for RiveScript documents.
  - Prefer the .rive extension for RS documents over the old .rs extension.
  - Track filenames and line numbers when parsing RiveScript documents.
  - Add Perl object handler example.
  - Add current_user() method accessible from inside an object macro.
  - Add unit tests.
  - Add deparse() function that dumps the active memory state of the bot.
  - Add write() method that writes the active memory state back to disk as a
    .rive file (uses deparse()).
  - Bugfix with substitution placeholders.
  - Bugfix with the <input> and <reply> tags.

1.01  May 20 2013
  - Small bugfix in _rot13 that caused crashes under certain circumstances.
  - Small bugfix regarding the {weight} tag and atomic triggers.
  - Restructure the RiveScript library (move rivescript.py into a package
    folder named 'rivescript', separate the interactive mode code into
    interactive.py)

1.00  Apr 22 2012
  - Initial version of rivescript.py
